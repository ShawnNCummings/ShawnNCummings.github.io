I am committed to sharing all code associated with my publications to promote reproducibility, replication, and reanalysis. Analysis scripts along with trial level data can be found in the [OSF](https://osf.io/92hk3/) repositories associated with each of my projects.

Additionally, many of my projects involve acoustic synthesis. Where this involves creation of custom Praat scripts, those are shared in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShawnNCummings/praatScripts).
