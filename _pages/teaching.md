As a scientist, I believe dissemination of knowledge is as important as its generation. As a teacher, I believe **meeting students where they are** and promoting self-development are as important as content knowledge itself.

My formal training in college instruction comes from a [U.S. Department of Education Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/gaann-fellowship-program/) training grant, where I engaged in pedagogical coursework, cohort meetings, and supervised teaching.

I have had the opportunity to teach across three departments at the University of Connecticut, including development of a graduate seminar in Hearing and Speech Science. Specific courses are delineated in my [CV](https://shawnncummings.github.io/files/Cummings_CV_090125.pdf).

Feel free to contact me for a more detailed statement on my teaching experiences and philosophy!
