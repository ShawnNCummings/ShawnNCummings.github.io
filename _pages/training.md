I firmly believe that progress in complex fields requires the perspectives of many disciplines. We cannot, for example, understand adaptation in speech perception without a firm grasp both of the science of speech ([linguistics](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/), [SLHS](https://speech-language-hearing.uconn.edu/)), as well as the principles underlying perceptual learning as it applies both to the mind ([psychology](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/), [cognitive science](https://cogsci.uconn.edu/graduate-certificate/)) and brain ([cognitive neuroscience](https://cncct.research.uconn.edu/), [neurobiology](https://nbl.cogsci.uconn.edu/)). In my academic journey I have sought formal training in each of these disciplines, and I look forward to continually furthering my breadth as well as depth of knowledge through collaborations and cross-training.

Specifically:

-   My undergraduate training at the University of Rochester (B.A., 2021) is in [Linguistics](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/) and [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/).

-   I began my graduate education at the University of Connecticut in the [Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences](https://speech-language-hearing.uconn.edu/), and earned joint affiliation with the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/) (M.S., 2024; Ph.D., 2025).

-   While at UConn, I additionally earned graduate certificates in [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.uconn.edu/graduate-certificate/) and the [Neurobiology of Language](https://nbl.cogsci.uconn.edu/).

-   Finally, I was awarded fellowship by three external grants over the course of my graduate studies. These included an NSF grant focused on the [Science of Learning and Art of Communication](https://web.archive.org/web/20240707222724/https://slac.uconn.edu/), an NIH T32 focused on [Cognitive Neuroscience of Communication](https://cncct.research.uconn.edu/), and a [GAANN fellowship in Cognitive Psychology and Psycholinguistics](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/language-and-cognition/gaann-fellowship-program/).
